    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. **Naive Bayes** - Naive Bayes classification is well suited for parsing text documents and labeling these documents. Specifically, the text documents may be emails where the emails are labeled as spam and not spam. For this reason it has been applied to sorting email inboxes to help filter out spam email (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/naivebayes.pdf). Naive Bayes is a relatively simple model which gives the model the strength of easily scaling to large data sets. The Naive Bayes model assumes independence between each feature in the training data. If this independence holds true in the data, Naive Bayes can outperform other models with small amounts of training data. The conditional independence assumption also allows Naive Bayes to work will with non-uniformly distributed data. A weakness of Naive Bayes can also be found in the simplicity of the model. This model is unable to adapt to new feature-label associations and therefore will predict the likelihood of this event as zero. Another instance where Naive Bayes performs poorly is when multiple features are corelated and therefore break the conditional independence assumption. Naive Bayes could be a good candidate for the finding donors application becase it can easily handle large data sets. We have seen that the capitol gains and capitol loss features are not well distributed. The Naive Bayes model will not be influnced by this characteristic in the data and supports the use of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression** - The output of logistic regression is mapped to a value between 0 and 1 in the form of a probability. A threshold can then be set to map the probability output to True or False. Logistic regression is often used in medical studies for applying a probability to a patients likelihood of having a particular disease or progression of a disease (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16779367). Logistic regression is very well suited for data sets that have a single, clear decision boundary. Logistic regression also works well with multidimensional data and also with data that displays correlations between features. One particular strength of this model this that it can be forced to generalize to the data by applying penalties to coefficients in the model and thereby avoid overfitting the data. A weekness of of this model is that it performs poorly on data that have multiple or nonlinear decision boundaries. I'm hypothesizing that multiple features in the dataset are correlated to capital gains and capitol loss such as education level, race, and sex so I believe logistic regression will be able to model the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient Boosting** - The gradient boost classifier builds a model by sequentially building decision trees where each subsequest tree is built based on reducing the error of the predecessor tree. Gradient boost trees aim to generalize to the training data by building weak learners, essentially shallow trees that only slighty better preidict a label than a 50-50 guess. A successful real-world application of gradient boosting is predicting the direction of change in stock prices to ultimately decide whether or not to buy or sell a stock (https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=27932). Advantages of gradient boosting include rapid prediction times becasue training data is not retained for prediction. Another strength of gradient boosting is that they are easily applied to high dimensional data. One final strength, gradient boosting can be forced to generalize to the data by applying shrinkage, penalizing complex trees, and applying stochastic gradient boosting to build trees on random subsets of the data. A significant disadvantage of gradient boosing is time required to build the model. Trees are build sequentially and the data set grows, the time to train the model grows significantly. When building a gradient boosting model it is important to understand that these models can easily overfit to the training data if regularization tools (shrinkage, preventing complex trees, etc.) are not used. Another significant disadvantage to this type of classifier is that they are difficult to interpret and visualize and therefore it is potentially difficult to understand how the model arrived at an outcome. Gradient boosting can be a very accurate model when large data sets are available and the data contains multiple features for training. The census data is fairly large and has many features for the model to use for training, so I believe this will be a strong candidate for predicting income."

    "**Answer: ** After experimenting with several classification models, it is clear that a gradient boosting classifier is best suited to CharityML's objectives for identifying potential doners. Metrics used to support this conclusion are F-score accuracy, and training and predicting time. The highest F-score and greatest accuracy was achieved using gradient boosting with an F-score of 0.74 and an accuracy of 0.86. This challenge of identifying potential donors has the ultimate goal of generating the highest return on marketing investments. With that said, accuracy is an important metric for this study because we want to minimize the number of marketing materials arriving at households that are unlikely to donate. A high F-score is also a key metric in selecting a classifier because it provides the harmonic mean of recall and precision, and therefore how well the model scored in these metrics. The largest drawback of gradient boositing is training time. This classifier takes about 10 times longer to train when compared to Naive Bayes classification and logistic regression. Gradient boosting comes in at 10 seconds of training time on slighly over 45,000 samples. Once the model is trained, prediction time is very fast at about 0.03 seconds. This prediction time is only fractions of a second slower than the other models explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient boosting classifier is very well suited to the census data set for a number of reasons. To begin, this data set is sufficiently large for gradient boosting to accurately identify features that best predict income level and minimize error in predictions. This model also works well with the large number of features found in the data set particularly after the data preprocessing step. As discussed earlier, the census data set is not well distributed and more samples in the date have an income of less than 50K as opposed to samples with an income greater than or equal to 50K. Gradient boosting classifiers do not require data sets with balanced classes unlike other models. For this reason, gradient boosting is a very stong candidate for modeling the data without generating error from unballanced data."

    "**Answer: ** Gradient boosting classification is an evolved form of decision tree classification where the driving force in training the model comes from reducing error in the more difficult samples to classify. Decision tree models are built by analyzing features of a data set and determining which features, and what values of these features, most strongly correlate with a particular class. An input to a decision tree is placed into a class by comparing features of the input to rules at each decision node to determine which branch to follow next until a classification, or leaf, is reached. Gradient boosting begins by building a weak learner decision tree where the tree is only slightly better at classifying the input than random chance. The results of the initial decision tree is then fed into a loss function to calculate the error of this tree. The next step in training the gradient boosting classifier is to build a new decision tree classifier, but this time the decision tree is trained on the error, or residulas, from the first model to try to better classify the inputs. The initial model and the model of the residuals is then fed into an additive function to combine the two into one, more accurate model. To summarize the three important steps: a model is built on features of the data, a second model is built on the error of the first model, the two models are combined in an additive function to produce one model. The gradient portion of gradient boosting comes into play when these three steps are repeated sequentially and the error from each iteration is reduced using gradient descent. The key to this classifier's strategy to reducing error lies in focusing on the samples that generate the largest error. In other words, gradient boosting put more effort into correctly classifying the samples that it gets wrong rather than on samples it can easily classify."

I expect individuals making over 50K to have more investments than those making under 50K who may have little to no investments. Simularly, I predict capitol loss to be the next most significant feature for the same reason as capital gains. If an individual has large capitol loss (or gains) they are likely to have large investments and therefore are likely to make over 50K. I consider occupaiton to be the third most influential predictor in predicting income. Executive, management, technical jobs, etc. are very likely to pay over 50K however this varies significantly between industries. I believe education number to be the fourth strongest predictor in an individuals income. I believe there is a strong correlation between education level and income, where people with bachelors degrees or higher are likely to hold well paying jobs and make over 50K. I expect the final influential feature of the five most important to be race. Historically there has been a large wage gap between caucasions and minority races with high paying jobs typically being help by white individuals."

    "**Answer:** I correctly predicted three of the five most significant features but was not completely correct in their importance relative to eachother. It appears that capitol gain and capito loss were very important when training the model but were not the most significant. Surprisingly, education number is the single best feature for predicting income while I considered occupation to be more important. I did not expect marital status to be a significant feature, however I can see individuals with families having a greater drive to improve their income level. I'm not surprised to see age as a strong predictor for income level, with older people being more likely to make over 50K than young individuals. I assumed age as a predictor would break down once age gets high enough where individuals reach retirement age."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
